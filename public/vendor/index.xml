      <description>Security notices relating to PHPMailer Please disclose any vulnerabilities found responsibly - report any security problems found to the maintainers privately.
PHPMailer versions prior to 6.0.6 and 5.2.27 are vulnerable to an object injection attack by passing phar:// paths into addAttachment() and other functions that may receive unfiltered local paths, possibly leading to RCE. Recorded as CVE-2018-19296. See this article for more info on this type of vulnerability. Mitigated by blocking the use of paths containing URL-protocol style prefixes such as phar://.</description>

      <description>Valitron: Easy Validation That Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Suck Valitron is a simple, minimal and elegant stand-alone validation library with NO dependencies. Valitron uses simple, straightforward validation methods with a focus on readable and concise syntax. Valitron is the simple and pragmatic validation library you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.
  
Why Valitron? Valitron was created out of frustration with other validation libraries that have dependencies on large components from other frameworks like Symfony&amp;rsquo;s HttpFoundation, pulling in a ton of extra files that aren&amp;rsquo;t really needed for basic validation.</description>
